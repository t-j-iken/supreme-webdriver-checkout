# UPDATE: No longer works. Uses a previous version of Selenium and Supreme's backend has changed. Needs to be updated!

## Supreme Webdriver Auto Checkout

### Background

Supreme offers extremely limited new items every week during a season. These items have limited inventory and can sellout within ten to 60 seconds. Most auto checkouts _POST_ checkout data and information, but Supreme counters this with the use of the "evil" _pookie.js_ file uploaded backend. 

This checkout uses an automated Chrome webdriver to navigate through the site and checkout specific items.

### Usage

Use any editor and edit the variables of the item you want to purchase. Add checkout information and bank card information to the script. Run the python script.
